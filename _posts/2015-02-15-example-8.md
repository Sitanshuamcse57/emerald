Hey Guys, 🙋🏻‍♂️

Over here I will tell you my experience with doing amfoss task which I have been doing for last One month.

Let me just start by saying ,after doing this task for last one month I have seen that it is an amazing way to set the beginner bar. This is because before I used to restrict myself from trying out different things🤷🏻‍♂️, thinking that it is for people with great programming knowledge, but later I found that things are not that difficult than they seems to be.
For example Aerglo Mars Task in which we had to set up an API or the Rich Scraper task in which we had to scrap live data from the website. These tasks made me more confident with many things in the computer and I did enjoy my task doing. I would suggest anyone with some interest in computers should try out these tasks, it will help build there confidence with computer👨🏻‍💻 and show them what’s possible.

I think the Tasks given were well structured from 1 to 10 with 5 additional tasks, this did not build huge pressure on the doer and enough pressure to help them raise their bar up.🏋️‍♂️ The task that I enjoyed the most was the personal website task (This one itself) and the JSExplorer. And most difficult for me was the flutter task as it took me quite of time to understand it😅.

Also, I would give all my thank to my mentor Yash bhiaya and Advaith bhaiya who helped me every time when I was stuck with any task.

Thank you for reading🤩.
